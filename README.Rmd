> A Toolkit for Using EnergyPlus in R.

eplusr provides a rich toolkit of using whole building energy simulation program
[EnergyPlus](https://energyplus.net) directly in R, which enables programmatic
navigation, modification of EnergyPlus, conducts parametric simulations and
retrieves outputs. More information about EnergyPlus can be found at [its
website](https://energyplus.net).

A comprehensive introduction to eplusr can be found using
[`vignette("eplusr")`](https://hongyuanjia.github.io/eplusr/articles/eplusr.html).
You can learn more about eplusr at https://hongyuanjia.github.io/eplusr, along
with full package documentation.

## Installation

You can install the latest stable release of eplusr from CRAN.

```{r cran-install, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("eplusr")
```

Alternatively, you can install the development version from GitHub.

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("hongyuanjia/eplusr")
```

Since running the IDF files requires EnergyPlus (https://energyplus.net),
EnergyPlus has to be installed if you want to run EnergyPlus models in R.  There
are helper functions in eplusr to download and install it automatically on major
operating systems (Windows, macOS and Linux):

```{r eplus-install, eval = FALSE}
# install the latest version (currently v9.1.0)
eplusr::install_eplus("latest")

# OR download the latest version (currently v9.1.0) and run the installer
# manually by yourself
eplusr::download_eplus("latest", dir = tempdir())
```

Note that the installation process in `install_eplus()` requires
**administrative privileges**. You have to run R with administrator (or with
sudo if you are on macOS or Linux) to make it work if you are not in interactive
mode.

```{r install_eplus, include = FALSE}
if (!eplusr::is_avail_eplus(8.8)) eplusr::install_eplus(8.8)
```

## Features

* Read, parse and modify EnergyPlus Input Data File (IDF)
* Read, parse and modify EnergyPlus Weather File (EPW)
* Query on models, including classes, objects and fields
* Directly add, modify, duplicate, insert, and delete objects of IDF
* Automatically change referenced fields when modifying objects
* Save changed models into standard formats in the same way as IDFEditor
  distributed along with EnergyPlus
* Run your models and collect the simulation output
* Conduct parametric energy simulations and collect all results in one go

## Usage overview

### Class structure

Below shows the class structure in eplusr.

<p align="center">
  <img src="man/figures/class_structure.png"/>
</p>

Basically, eplusr uses `Idf` class to present the whole IDF file and `IdfObject`
class to present a single object in an IDF. Both `Idf` and `IdfObject` class
contain member functions for helping modify the data in IDF so it complies with
the underlying EnergyPlus IDD (Input Data Dictionary). Similarly, IDD file is
wrapped into two classes, i.e. `Idd` and `IddObject`.

Besides, `Epw` class is used to present EnergyPlus Weather files; `EplusJob` to
run single EnergyPlus simulation and collect outputs, `ParametricJob` to run
parametric EnergyPlus simulations and collect all outputs.

It is highly recommended to read the documentation to get a thorough
understanding on each class.

### Getting started

```{r load, out.lines = 30}
library(eplusr)

# parse IDD
idd <- use_idd(8.8, download = "auto")

# read IDF
idf <- read_idf(system.file("extdata/1ZoneUncontrolled.idf", package = "eplusr"))

# print idf
idf

# extract object
idf$Material_NoMass$R13LAYER

# get object relation
idf$object_relation("R13LAYER", "all")

# extract field value
idf$RunPeriod[[1]][c("Begin Month", "End Month")]

# add new object
idf$add(RunPeriod = list("run_period", 3, 1, 4, 1))

# get possible values for fields
idf$Construction$FLOOR$value_possible("Outside Layer")

# read EPW
path_epw <- file.path(eplus_config(8.8)$dir, "WeatherData/USA_CA_San.Francisco.Intl.AP.724940_TMY3.epw")
epw <- read_epw(path_epw)

# print weather
epw

# get location
(loc <- epw$location())

# update Site:Location according to EPW LOCATION header
idf$Site_Location$set(
  name = paste(loc$city, loc$state_province, loc$country),
  loc$latitude, loc$longitude, loc$time_zone, loc$elevation
)

# save the IDF
idf$save(file.path(tempdir(), "model.idf"), overwrite = TRUE)

# extract weather data
(weather <- head(epw$data()))

# a date time column added with correct start day of week type
epw$period()$start_day_of_week
weekdays(weather$datetime)

# run simulation
job <- idf$run(epw)

# print simulation error
job$errors()

# get report data
results <- job$report_data("zone one", "zone mean air temperature",
  case = "example", month = 1:6, hour = 1, day_type = "Monday",
  all = TRUE
)
str(results)

# a date time column added with correct day of week type
all(weekdays(results$datetime) == results$day_type)

# get tabular data
job$tabular_data(table_name = "site and source energy", row_name = "total site energy")
```

```{r del_job, include = FALSE}
clean_wd(idf$path())
unlink(idf$path())
```
