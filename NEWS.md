# eplusr 0.8.2

## New feature

* `$get_value()` in `IdfObject` class new has a new argument `simplify`. If
  `TRUE`, a character vecotr will be returned instead of a named list. Default
  is `FALSE`.

## Minor changes

* The names of returned list of `$get_value()` in `IdfObject` is "underscore"
  name, not lower name. This makes its behavior being consistent with
  `$object()` in `Idf` class.

## Bug fixes

* Fix warning messages of column type coercion from data.table in `Idf` and
  `IdfObject`.

* `$set_value()` in `IdfObject` and `$set_object()` in `Idf` now will delete empty
   fields with empty value. This fix the error when trying to reassign only some
   empty fields which have been deleted before.
